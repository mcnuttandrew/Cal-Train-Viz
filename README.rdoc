==  Visualization Data Server	


Rails server for displaying visualization of data. Generally a sandbox for toying around with different things. The main thing living on here right now is a d3 "app" that shows the cal tran train schedule for weekdays. 

Cal tran implementation notes:

The biz logic for is in pure d3 and vanilla js, which is stored in the js assets.
The main todo on this project is now setting up a notion of current train.
